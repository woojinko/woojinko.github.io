In CS 294-137 VR + Immersive Computing, my group and I completed a capstone project under the guidance of Professor Bjoern Hartmann and HCI PhD candidate Bala Kumaravel. We devised an electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) haptic-feedback system to augment VR experiences, where I worked on building VR scenes and the Arduino Unity-EMS circuit bridge. I gained exposure to rigorous prototyping cycles, involving user-oriented creative planning and adaptive design iterations. We targeted certain muscle groups and stimulation timings to endow the most realism to the usersâ€™ immersion. Going forward, I am excited to pursue my Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences honors program research HCI thesis under the mentorship of Prof. Hartmann. Broadly, I am looking to further explore collaborative virtual experiences and social discourse in another intersection of HCI and MR.
