        </h2>

        <p>
            I am a <strong>leftist, anti-capitalist, and probably communist</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I support the <strong>Palestinian fight for liberation</strong> against the Israeli occupation and genocide in
            Gaza.
        </p>

        <p>
            I advocate for <strong>labor rights</strong>. I currently organize for <strong>Cornell&#39;s Graduate
                Student Union</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I identify with <strong>neurodivergence</strong>. My <strong>cyclothymia</strong> (mood disorder) manifests
            itself in cyclical episodes of depression and hypomania, usually beyond my control. I also self-identify with
            <strong>autism spectrum disorder</strong> (ASD). Through years of therapy, medication, and self-reflection, I
            have found ways to mask many of my autism-related social behaviors situationally. I acknowledge that this gives
            me a great deal of <strong>privilege relative to many other autistic folks</strong>, especially in work
            environments and other social settings that lack thoughtful accommodations. Meanwhile, I continue to regularly
            deal with co-morbid symptoms of <strong>depression, anxiety, and chronic pain</strong>; masking as neurotypical
            often intensifies these symptoms for me over time.
        </p>

        <p>
            I feel pretty <strong>gender-fluid</strong> nowadays. In my explorations of gender identity and expression, I
            have found that I can take things slowly, at my own pace, without feeling much gender dysphoria. I acknowledge
            that this also gives me a great deal of <strong>privilege relative to many trans / nonbinary folks</strong>,
            since I can easily express as a cisgender man in unsafe environments to avoid microaggressions, abuse, etc.

            I am a <strong>2nd year PhD student</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Cornell
                Tech</strong> (Cornell&#39;s NYC graduate campus).
        </p>

        <p>
            I am advised by <a href="https://shiriazenkot.wixsite.com/shiri-azenkot">Prof. Shiri Azenkot</a> in the
            <strong>Enhancing Ability Lab</strong>. I am also a member of the <a
                href="https://xr.cornell.edu/collaboratory">XR Collaboratory</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current research in <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> focuses on the intersection of extended
            /virtual / augmented reality <strong>(XR / VR / AR)</strong> and <strong>mental health + accessibility</strong>.
            My past projects have spanned various application areas such as healthcare, music, and architecture.

        <p>
            I feel grateful to be working in this space alongside like-minded
            collaborators towards what we hope can be meaningful social change.
            Yet I have learned to feel even more gratitude for people who see
            things differently, those who cannot help but express surprise, doubt,
            fear, worry, or criticism in the face of this research field. After all,
            XR has become largely synonymous with the metaverse and other dystopian
            visions of late-stage capitalism. I resonate with the opinion that big tech
            companies and leadership in recent years have done little to inspire
            hope in collective good, social safety nets, or prioritization of people
            over profits. I deeply admire those who refuse to just idolize modern day
            technology. We cannot let &quot;innovation&quot; whitewash or excacerbate the troubling
            flaws in our current exploitative systems that continue to fail vulnerable populations.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I try to remind myself how XR and technology
            can allure us with the hope of a better future. For example,
            I love how XR can blend the physical and virtual worlds of its users,
            enabling immersive social interaction and expressive collaboration.
            I appreciate that XR interfaces exist in the same
            3D world as us, making digital technology more intuitive and natural
            for us to use. I enjoy the interdisciplinary nature of XR; it can extend
            to nearly any social context, including the healthcare and accessibility
            settings I work in today. I hope to continue working on XR projects with
            the aim of helping those in need or directly building up the skills to do so.

        <p>
            Previously, I graduated from <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> with a B.S. in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Science as a member of the <a
                href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors">Berkeley EECS Honors Program</a>. I worked
            under the supervision of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern">Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a>
            in the <a href="https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a>, <a
                href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/luisa-caldas">Prof. Luisa Caldas</a> in the <a
                href="https://xrlab.berkeley.edu">XR Lab</a>, and <a

        </p>

        <p>
            After finishing my undergraduate in 2021, I deferred
            my PhD admission to take a gap year. Post COVID burnout,
            I wanted to catch my breath and work on recuperating my mental health.
            I later interned as a technical exhibit designer at the
            <a href="https://momath.org">National Museum of Mathematics</a>.
            I was also fortunate enough to have the means to travel to various parts of the world.
