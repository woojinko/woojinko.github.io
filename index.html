        About Me
    </h1>

    <p>
        My name is Woojin, and I am a <strong>3rd year PhD student</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Cornell
            Tech</strong>. I am a member of the <a
            href="https://xrcollaboratory.tech.cornell.edu/">XR Collaboratory</a>.
    </p>      

    <p>
        My current research in <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> focuses on 
        the intersection of technology and <strong>neurodivergence / mental health</strong>. I primarily 
        work on the development and design process of <strong> 3D user interfaces and interactions </strong>
        for <strong> virtual and augmented reality applications (VR / AR)</strong>. My past projects have
        spanned various application areas such as at-home healthcare, architectural design, music, and more.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
        Despite working in these tech spaces, I strongly support people who express 
        doubt, fear, anger, and worry towards the future of technology and its impacts 
        on society. I definitely used to be more optimistic, but honestly, so much of
        the power and control over these technologies is concentrated in the hands of a 
        few tech companies that are worth gazillions of dollars but continue to prioritize
        profits over people. We currently live in a world dominated by late-stage capitalism, 
        largely led by Western powers that claim to champion democracy and human rights 
        but disguise an ugly underbelly of colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy
        that rules the world to this day...
    </p>

    <p> So how much do these new advancements in technology ACTUALLY serve the people,
        in a way that we actually want? Does a "VR metaverse on the blockchain" REALLY help us
        afford tuition, healthcare, rent? As the latest "AI" advancements continue to replace
        real human jobs, are governments acting quickly enough to create more jobs, 
        or at least work towards providing universal basic income for those who are pushed out?
    </p>

    <p>
        For those of us who exist in these tech spaces and share these worries, we 
        can only try our best to try to help move technology in better directions. 
        So far in my school experiences, I think this has come most meaningfully NOT through 
        any paper or project I've worked on, but through organizing and agitating around
        social issues - grad student labor rights, Palestinian liberation, etc.

        Previously, I graduated from <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> with a B.S. in Electrical
        Engineering and Computer Science as a member of the <a
            href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors">Berkeley EECS Honors Program</a>. I worked
        under the supervision of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern">Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a>
        in the <a href="https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a>, <a
            href="https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/luisa-caldas">Prof. Luisa Caldas</a> in the <a
            href="https://berkeleyxrlab.org/">XR Lab</a>, and <a

        After finishing my undergraduate in 2021, I deferred
        my PhD admission to take a gap year. Post COVID burnout,
        I wanted to catch my breath and work on recuperating my mental health.
        I later interned as a technical exhibit designer at the
        <a href="https://momath.org">National Museum of Mathematics</a>.
        I was also fortunate enough to have the means to travel to various parts of the world.
