        About Me
    </h1>

    <p>
        My name is Woojin, and I am a <strong>3rd year PhD student</strong> in <strong>Computer Science</strong> at <strong>Cornell
            Tech</strong>. I am a member of the <a
            href="https://xrcollaboratory.tech.cornell.edu/">XR Collaboratory</a>.
    </p>      

    <p>
        My current research in <strong>human-computer interaction</strong> focuses on 
        the intersection of technology and <strong>neurodivergence / mental health</strong>. I primarily 
        work on the development and design process of <strong> 3D user interfaces and interactions </strong>
        for <strong> virtual and augmented reality applications (VR / AR)</strong>. My past projects have
        spanned various application areas such as at-home healthcare, architectural design, music, and more.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
        Despite working in these tech spaces, I strongly support people who express 
        doubt, fear, anger, and worry towards the future of technology and its impacts 
        on society. I definitely used to be more optimistic, but honestly, so much of
        the power and control over these technologies is concentrated in the hands of a 
        few tech companies that are worth gazillions of dollars but continue to prioritize
        profits over people. We currently live in a world dominated by late-stage capitalism, 
        largely led by Western powers that claim to champion democracy and human rights 
        but disguise an ugly underbelly of colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy
        that rules the world to this day...
    </p>

    <p> So how much do these new advancements in technology ACTUALLY serve the people,
        in a way that we actually want? Does a "VR metaverse on the blockchain" REALLY help us
        afford tuition, healthcare, rent? As the latest "AI" advancements continue to replace
        real human jobs, are governments acting quickly enough to create more jobs, 
        or at least work towards providing universal basic income for those who are pushed out?
    </p>

    <p>
        For those of us who exist in these tech spaces and share these worries, we 
        can only try our best to try to help move technology in better directions. 
        So far in my school experiences, I think this has come most meaningfully NOT through 
        any paper or project I've worked on, but through organizing and agitating around
        social issues - grad student labor rights, Palestinian liberation, etc.

        Previously, I graduated from <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> with a B.S. in Electrical
        Engineering and Computer Science as a member of the <a
            href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors">Berkeley EECS Honors Program</a>. I worked
        under the supervision of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern">Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a>
        in the <a href="https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a>, <a

        After finishing my undergraduate in 2021, I deferred
        my PhD admission to take a gap year. Post COVID burnout,
        I wanted to catch my breath and work on recuperating my mental health.
        I later interned as a technical exhibit designer at the
        <a href="https://momath.org">National Museum of Mathematics</a>.
        I was also fortunate enough to have the means to travel to various parts of the world.

            Identities

        <p>
            I feel pretty <strong>gender-fluid</strong> nowadays. In my explorations of gender identity and expression, I
            have found that I can take things slowly, at my own pace, without feeling much gender dysphoria. I acknowledge
            that this <strong>privileges</strong> me relative to many trans / nonbinary folks.
            since I can often mask as a cisgender man in unsafe environments to avoid microaggressions, abuse, etc.

        <p>
            I believe in and practice <strong>ethical non-monogamy</strong>, more specifically <strong>polyamory</strong>

            I <strong>self-identify</strong> as <strong>neurodivergent</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I self-identify with <strong>cyclothymia, </strong> a type of mood disorder (received a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1588247/">psychiatric diagnosis</a> in 2021). 
            My cyclothymia manifests itself in regular episodes of depression and occasional hypomania, usually beyond my control.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also self-identify with traits characteristic of <a href="https://behavioral-innovations.com/blog/the-sudden-rise-of-audhd/"><strong>AuDHD</strong></a> - <strong>autism spectrum disorder (ASD) co-occurring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</strong>.
            I am actively working with my health practitioners to seek an official evaluation. I am hoping to better understand what such an evaluation process looks like from a 
            health professional / specialist. I would also like to think critically about comparing medical and self diagnosis in relation to external validity / refutability as well as barriers 
            such as high costs, cultural stigmas, and generational differences in mental health awareness / access.
        </p>
        <p>
            I acknowledge that I self-identify with AuDHD traits as a speaking individual without co-occurring intellectual disabilities. 
            I am able to mask many of my AuDHD-related communication behaviors situationally, privileging me relative to many other folks with AuDHD, autism, or ADHD.
            This has made it especially difficult for me to figure out whether identifying with AuDHD felt right for me. I feared 
            delegitimizing or drawing inaccurate comparisons to the experiences and accommodations of other AuDHD folks who do not share
            my privileges. Only recently have I been able to overcome this stigma on what autism and ADHD must publicly present as,
            able to internalize that these conditions exist on spectrums. I am able to feel more secure in this inclusive model of 
            self-identification nowadays, without feeling the pressure to justify or explain my experiences unless requested.
        </p>

        <p> 
            My ability to <a href="https://www.kadiant.com/post/resources-for-understanding-masking">mask</a> my gender and disability identities is the only way I have found to take care of myself in many social settings, 
            especially for surviving traditional work/academic environments that do not accommodate sensitively for these identities. 
                However, masking also comes at a cost for me. 
            Beyond finding it hard to be my true self around most people, I also
                know that masking often leads to extreme exhaustion and intensifies flare-ups of co-morbid symptoms of <strong>depression, anxiety, and chronic pain</strong> 
                that, at their worst, can incapacitate me. I thank my physical therapist, psychiatrist, and psychotherapist for enabling me to exist 
                through the stresses and challenges of this PhD program.
