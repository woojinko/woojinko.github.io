            I feel pretty <strong>gender-fluid</strong> nowadays. In my explorations of gender identity and expression, I
            have found that I can take things slowly, at my own pace, without feeling much gender dysphoria. I acknowledge
            that this <strong>privileges</strong> me relative to many trans / nonbinary folks.
            since I can often mask as a cisgender man in unsafe environments to avoid microaggressions, abuse, etc.

            I believe in and practice <strong>ethical non-monogamy</strong>, more specifically <strong>polyamory</strong>

            I <strong>self-identify</strong> as <strong>neurodivergent</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I self-identify with <strong>cyclothymia, </strong> a type of mood disorder (received a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1588247/">psychiatric diagnosis</a> in 2021). 
            My cyclothymia manifests itself in regular episodes of depression and occasional hypomania, usually beyond my control.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also self-identify with <a href="https://behavioral-innovations.com/blog/the-sudden-rise-of-audhd/"><strong>AuDHD</strong></a> - <strong>autism spectrum disorder (ASD) co-occurring with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</strong>.
            I am actively seeking an "official" medical diagnosis to help me better understand what a diagnosis process looks like from a professional / specialist. 
            I would also want to think critically about how to compare the valididty / medical cost / stigma between professional and self diagnosis.
        </p>
        <p>
            I acknowledge that I am a speaking AuDHD individual without co-occurring intellectual disabilities. I am able to mask many of
            my AuDHD-related social behaviors situationally, privileging me relative to many other folks with AuDHD, autism, or ADHD.
            This has made it especially difficult for me to figure out whether identifying with AuDHD felt right. I feared 
            delegitimizing or drawing inaccurate comparisons to the experiences and accommodations of other AuDHD folks who do not share
            my privileges. Only recently have I been able to overcome this stigma on what autism and ADHD must publicly present as,
            able to internalize that these conditions exist on spectrums, and able to feel more secure in the inclusive model of self-identification.
        </p>

        <p> 
            My ability to <a href="https://www.kadiant.com/post/resources-for-understanding-masking">mask</a> my gender and disability identities is the only way I have found to take care of myself in many social settings, 
            especially for surviving traditional work/academic environments that do not accommodate sensitively for these identities. 
                However, masking also comes at a cost for me. 
            Beyond finding it hard to be my true self around most people, I also
                know that masking often intensifies flare-ups of my co-morbid symptoms of <strong>depression, anxiety, and chronic pain</strong>.
                I currently subsist in grad school with the help of psychiatric medication, regular therapy, and other self-care strategies.

        <h2>
            Reflections
        </h2>

        <p>
            I feel grateful to be working in this space alongside like-minded
            collaborators towards what we hope can be meaningful social change.
            Yet I have learned to feel even more gratitude for people who see
            things differently, those who cannot help but express surprise, doubt,
            fear, worry, or criticism in the face of this research field. After all,
            XR has become largely synonymous with the metaverse and other dystopian
            visions of late-stage capitalism. I resonate with the opinion that big tech
            companies and leadership in recent years have done little to inspire
            hope in collective good, social safety nets, or prioritization of people
            over profits. I deeply admire those who refuse to just idolize modern day
            technology. We cannot let "innovation" whitewash or excacerbate the troubling
            flaws in our current exploitative systems that continue to fail vulnerable populations.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, I try to remind myself how XR and technology
            can allure us with the hope of a better future. For example,
            I love how XR can blend the physical and virtual worlds of its users,
            enabling immersive social interaction and expressive collaboration.
            I appreciate that XR interfaces exist in the same
            3D world as us, making digital technology more intuitive and natural
            for us to use. I enjoy the interdisciplinary nature of XR; it can extend
            to nearly any social context, including the healthcare and accessibility
            settings I work in today. I hope to continue working on XR projects with
            the aim of helping those in need or directly building up the skills to do so.
        </p>

            Previously, I graduated from <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> with a B.S. in Electrical
            Engineering and Computer Science as a member of the <a
                href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors">Berkeley EECS Honors Program</a>. I worked
            under the supervision of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern">Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a>
            in the <a href="https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu">Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation</a>, <a

            After finishing my undergraduate in 2021, I deferred
            my PhD admission to take a gap year. Post COVID burnout,
            I wanted to catch my breath and work on recuperating my mental health.
            I later interned as a technical exhibit designer at the
            <a href="https://momath.org">National Museum of Mathematics</a>.
            I was also fortunate enough to have the means to travel to various parts of the world.
