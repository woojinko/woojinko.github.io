        I am a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at <a href=https://tech.cornell.edu>Cornell Tech</a> 
        / <a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu>Cornell University</a>. 
        I am advised by <a href=https://shiriazenkot.wixsite.com/shiri-azenkot>Prof. Shiri Azenkot</a> 
        in the <b>Enhancing Ability Lab</b>. I am also a member of the
        <a href=https://xr.cornell.edu/collaboratory><b>XR Collaboratory</b></a>.    
    </p>

    <p>
        My research in <b>human-computer interaction</b> focuses on the 
        intersection of <b>extended reality (XR)</b> and <b>mental health 
        + accessibility</b>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel grateful to be working in this space alongside like-minded
        collaborators, bringing together our personal and career passions
        towards what we hope can be meaningful social change. Yet I have learned
        to feel even more gratitude for those who see things differently, those who
        cannot help but express surprise, doubt, fear, worry, or criticism
        in the face of this research field. After all, XR has become largely synonymous 
        with the metaverse and other dystopian visions of late-stage capitalism. 
        I deeply admire those who refuse to idolize technology. We cannot let 
        "innovation" whitewash or excacerbate the troubling flaws in our 
        current systems that continue to fail vulnerable populations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the same time, I must remind myself that XR and technology 
        draws in many of us with the alluring hope for a better future. 
        I love how XR can blend the physical and virtual worlds of its users, 
        enabling immersive social interaction and expressive collaboration. 
        I enjoy the interdisciplinary nature of XR; it can extend to nearly any 
        social context, including the healthcare and accessibility settings 
        I work in today. I appreciate that XR interfaces exist in the same 
        3D world as us, making digital technology more intuitive and natural 
        for us to use. I hope to continue working on XR projects with the aim 
        of helping those in need or building up the skills to do so.

        I try my best to maintain a healthy work-life balance, which can too often
        feel impossible in academia (or most any other job under late-stage capitalism). 
        The elitism, the hierarchy of underpaid exploitation, the perverse incentive structure 
        that prioritizes prestige and profit over people... the academic industrial complex. 
        Even as the ivory tower of academia crumbles before my eyes, I have continued to encounter
        many bright spots by meeting some incredible fellow students and academics. With these folks,
        I have been learning to practice healthy communication, to establish mutual understanding 
        of expectations and boundaries, and to organize under a grad student labor union.

        Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical 
        Engineering and Computer Science as a member of the
        <a href=https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors>
        Berkeley EECS Honors Program</a>. I worked under the supervision of 
        <a href=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern>Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a> 
        in the <a href=https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu><b>Jacobs Institute 
        for Design Innovation</b></a>, <a href=https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/luisa-caldas>
        Prof. Luisa Caldas</a> in the <a href=https://xrlab.berkeley.edu><b>XR Lab</b></a>, 
        and <a href=https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/people/allen-y-yang>
        Dr. Allen Yang</a> in the <a href=https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu><b>
        FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality</b></a>.

        After finishing my undergraduate in 2021, I deferred 
        my PhD admission to take a gap year. Post COVID burnout, 
        I wanted to catch my breath and work on recuperating my mental health. 
        I later interned as a technical exhibit designer at the 
        <a href=https://momath.org><b>National Museum of Mathematics</b></a>.
        I was also fortunate enough to have the means to travel to various parts of the world.
