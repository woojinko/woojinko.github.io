        My name is Woojin (he/they)
        <br>
        I am a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell Tech
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size:24px">
        I focus on the design and development of novel, immersive interfaces 
        that enable human interactions to be more personal, realistic, and empathetic. 
        <br>
        <br>
        My current research interests lie in the intersection of:
        <br>
        - mixed reality (XR)
        <br>
        - (physical/mental) healthcare and accessiblity 
        <br>
        - human-computer interaction (HCI)
        <br>
        - applied computer vision (CV)
        <br>
        <br>
        While I find myself appreciating virtual/augmented/mixed reality
        (VR/AR/MR) interfaces and their unparalleled capacity for immersive interaction 
        and expressive collaboration, I am passionate about leveraging a wide range of 
        technologies for social good.

    <h3> Academic Story Thus Far </h3>

    <p style="font-size:24px">
        Back in May 2021, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and 
        Computer Science (Berkeley EECS Honors Program). 
        <br>
        <br>
        During my undergrad years, I worked under the supervision of Prof. Bjoern 
        Hartmann in the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation, Prof. Luisa Caldas in 
        the XR Lab, and Dr. Allen Yang in the FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality.
        <br>
        <br>
        After finishing my undergrad, I deferred my PhD admission to take a gap year. 
        I wanted to catch my breath, work on my mental health, and travel to different parts of the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, I have just finished up the first year of my PhD, and I am excited to see
        what the rest of my career journey looks like up ahead!
