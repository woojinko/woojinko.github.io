        I am a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at <a href=https://tech.cornell.edu>Cornell Tech</a> 
        / <a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu>Cornell University</a>. 
        I am advised by <a href=https://shiriazenkot.wixsite.com/shiri-azenkot>Prof. Shiri Azenkot</a> 
        in the <b>Enhancing Ability Lab</b>. I am also a member of the
        <a href=https://xr.cornell.edu/collaboratory><b>XR Collaboratory</b></a>.    
    </p>

    <p>
        My current research in <b>human-computer interaction</b> focuses on the 
        intersection of <b>extended / virtual / augmented reality (XR / VR / AR)</b> and <b>mental health 
        + accessibility</b>. My past research has spanned various application areas such as healthcare, 
        music, and architecture.

        I feel grateful to be working in this space alongside like-minded
        collaborators towards what we hope can be meaningful social change. 
        Yet I have learned to feel even more gratitude for people who see 
        things differently, those who cannot help but express surprise, doubt, 
        fear, worry, or criticism in the face of this research field. After all, 
        XR has become largely synonymous with the metaverse and other dystopian 
        visions of late-stage capitalism. I resonate with the opinion that big tech
        companies and leadership in recent years have done little to inspire 
        hope in collective good, social safety nets, or prioritization of people 
        over profits. I deeply admire those who refuse to just idolize modern day 
        technology. We cannot let "innovation" whitewash or excacerbate the troubling 
        flaws in our current exploitative systems that continue to fail vulnerable populations.
    </p>

        At the same time, I try to remind myself how XR and technology 
        can allure us with the hope of a better future. For example,
        I love how XR can blend the physical and virtual worlds of its users, 
        enabling immersive social interaction and expressive collaboration. 
        I appreciate that XR interfaces exist in the same 
        3D world as us, making digital technology more intuitive and natural 
        for us to use. I enjoy the interdisciplinary nature of XR; it can extend 
        to nearly any social context, including the healthcare and accessibility 
        settings I work in today. I hope to continue working on XR projects with 
        the aim of helping those in need or directly building up the skills to do so.

        Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical 
        Engineering and Computer Science as a member of the
        <a href=https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/undergrads/honors>
        Berkeley EECS Honors Program</a>. I worked under the supervision of 
        <a href=https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern>Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a> 
        in the <a href=https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu><b>Jacobs Institute 
        for Design Innovation</b></a>, <a href=https://ced.berkeley.edu/people/luisa-caldas>
        Prof. Luisa Caldas</a> in the <a href=https://xrlab.berkeley.edu><b>XR Lab</b></a>, 
        and <a href=https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/people/allen-y-yang>
        Dr. Allen Yang</a> in the <a href=https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu><b>
        FHL Vive Center for Enhanced Reality</b></a>.

        After finishing my undergraduate in 2021, I deferred 
        my PhD admission to take a gap year. Post COVID burnout, 
        I wanted to catch my breath and work on recuperating my mental health. 
        I later interned as a technical exhibit designer at the 
        <a href=https://momath.org><b>National Museum of Mathematics</b></a>.
        I was also fortunate enough to have the means to travel to various parts of the world.
